## Dice-Decide

## Introduction
A re-worked project from my bootcamp using `HTML, CSS & JavaScript`. The project has been developed to get a much better understanding of JavaScript basics.

## Description
The project is a basic game which originally could refresh to play and declare a player 1 or 2 winner. I added functionality including **assign names, button gameplay, and play multiple rounds**. 
Along with `JS` I used `HTML & CSS` to make the webpage more clear and attractive.
